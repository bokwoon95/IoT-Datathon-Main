# Optimising power using weather predictive models
Weather data can be used to predict the energy / power consumption of chiller systems, facilitated by accurate modelling of the correlation. 

**Through this challenge, participants will develop planning tools for performance optimisation of chillers.**

## Perfunctory Analysis

This is the power consumption across 4 chillers with the season as the independent variable. Y-axis is power, in watts. You can see that as the season gets colder, chiller power consumption decreases across the board. Except Chiller 4, which seems to be going against the trend instead. We have no idea why.
